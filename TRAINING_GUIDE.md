## 🚀 Training Configuration

### Current Training Parameters (Optimized for 4GB GPU)

```python
Model: YOLOv8n (Nano - smallest, fastest)
Epochs: 50
Image Size: 320x320
Batch Size: 1
Learning Rate: 0.01
Patience: 20 (early stopping)
Workers: 2

Memory Optimizations:
- Mosaic Augmentation: DISABLED ✓
- Mixup Augmentation: DISABLED ✓
- Cache: DISABLED ✓
- AMP: DISABLED (compatibility) ✓
```

### Why These Settings?

**GTX 1650 (4GB VRAM)** requires aggressive memory optimization:
- ✅ Small batch size (1) prevents OOM errors
- ✅ Reduced image size (320) saves memory
- ✅ Disabled mosaic saves 1.98 MiB per batch
- ✅ Minimal workers prevents RAM overflow
- ✅ YOLOv8n is the lightest model variant

## ⏱️ Training Timeline

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours (50 epochs)

**What to Expect:**
- **Epochs 1-10:** Model learns basic object detection
- **Epochs 10-25:** Performance improves rapidly
- **Epochs 25-40:** Fine-tuning and refinement
- **Epochs 40-50:** Convergence and final optimization

**Automatic Features:**
- ✅ Checkpoints saved every 10 epochs
- ✅ Best model auto-saved based on validation mAP

## 🔍 Monitoring Training

### Option 1: Check Progress in Terminal
```bash
# Training is running in background
# Output is being saved to logs
```

### Option 2: Check Results File
```bash
# View training metrics
cat glove_detection_project/run_4gb_optimized/results.csv
```

### Option 3: View Training Curves
Open `glove_detection_project/run_4gb_optimized/results.png` to see:
- Box Loss
- Classification Loss
- DFL Loss
- Precision
- Recall
- mAP@0.5
- mAP@0.5:0.95

## 🎯 Expected Performance

### Based on your dataset characteristics:

| Metric | Expected Range | Good Performance |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| mAP@0.5 | 0.70-0.85 | > 0.80 |
| mAP@0.5:0.95 | 0.45-0.65 | > 0.55 |
| Precision | 0.70-0.85 | > 0.75 |
| Recall | 0.65-0.80 | > 0.70 |
| Inference Speed | 30-50 FPS | > 40 FPS |

**Note:** YOLOv8n prioritizes speed over accuracy. For better accuracy, train YOLOv8s/m after validating the pipeline.

---

## ✅ After Training Completes

### 1. Evaluate the Model
```bash
python evaluate_and_infer.py
```

This will:
- Run comprehensive evaluation on test set
- Generate performance reports
- Create inference visualizations
- Benchmark inference speed

### 2. Test on Sample Images
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load your trained model
model = YOLO('glove_detection_project/run_4gb_optimized/weights/best.pt')

# Run inference
results = model('path/to/test/image.jpg')

# Display results
results[0].show()
```

### 3. Export for Deployment
```python
# Export to ONNX for production
model.export(format='onnx')

# Export to TensorRT for NVIDIA GPUs
model.export(format='engine')

# Export to TFLite for mobile
model.export(format='tflite')
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Training Fails Again

**1. Out of Memory Error:**
```bash
# Further reduce image size
imgsz: 256  # instead of 320

# Or use CPU training (slower but no memory limit)
device: 'cpu'
```

**2. Training Too Slow:**
```bash
# Reduce epochs for testing
epochs: 20

# Reduce validation frequency
val: False  # Only validate at end
```

**3. Poor Performance:**
- Check class balance (you have imbalance - Class 0: 62%)
- Increase training epochs (try 100-150)
- Use larger model after validating pipeline (YOLOv8s)
- Adjust confidence threshold during inference

---

## 📈 Next Steps After Training

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. ✅ Wait for training to complete (~2-3 hours)
2. ✅ Run evaluation script
3. ✅ Test on sample images
4. ✅ Review performance metrics

### Optional Improvements:
- **Better Accuracy:** Retrain with YOLOv8s/m (requires more memory)
- **Data Augmentation:** Enable mosaic if you upgrade GPU
- **More Data:** Add more examples for minority classes (1 & 3)
- **Fine-tuning:** Adjust confidence thresholds
- **Ensemble:** Combine multiple model predictions

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Monitor GPU Usage:**
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi -l 1  # Updates every second
   ```

2. **Resume Interrupted Training:**
   ```python
   model = YOLO('glove_detection_project/run_4gb_optimized/weights/last.pt')
   model.train(resume=True)
   ```

3. **Batch Inference:**
   ```python
   results = model(['img1.jpg', 'img2.jpg', 'img3.jpg'])
   ```

4. **Adjust Confidence:**
   ```python
   results = model('image.jpg', conf=0.3)  # Lower threshold
   ```

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the error logs in the training directory
2. Review the troubleshooting section above
3. Verify GPU memory with `nvidia-smi`
4. Try reducing batch size further (already at minimum)
5. Consider CPU training for testing

## 🏆 Success Criteria

Your model training is **successful** if:
- ✅ Training completes without errors
- ✅ mAP@0.5 > 0.70 on validation set
- ✅ Inference works on test images
- ✅ Predictions are reasonable for your use case
